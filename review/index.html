                <p><h4>My Review of Call of Duty Black Ops II</h4>
                My absolute favorite game of this series is Black Ops II. In my opinion it is hands down the best entry.<br> Everything was at a near perfect level starting with the campaign which throws twists and turns at you.<br>Its emotional and the best part in my opinion is how there are multiple endings so each playthrough could<br>be entirely different or completly the same. The next part of this amazing game is the amazing multiplayer.<br> It was balanced and yet very fast paced. There was a giant selection of weapons and abilities. The last and<br> my personal favorite gamemode is the thrilling and addicting zombies mode. The gist of the mode is that you<br> (solo or with 3 friends) have to survive a horde of zombies that are trying to eat you, it may seem simple but<br> there are many more things that make it interesting. from special perks to upgrading your weapons. My favorite<br> part is that there is a special easter egg on each map that uncovers a deep storyline that is continued from map<br> to map. With these three amazing elements it makes Black Ops II my favorite game of all time. </p>
                <p><h4>My Review of Pokemon Sapphire</h4>
                My second favorite game of all time would have to be pokemon sapphire. It was my first pokemon game and my<br> favorite entry in the franchise. Pokemon is about collecting monsters and having them battle for you. You battle<br> other trainers and try to beat them. There are 8 gym leaders in this game, after you defeat each one you go on to face<br> the elite four and eventually the champion of the reigon you are in. Pokemon sapphire takes place in the Hoen reigon<br> which is shaped a bit after hawai. Along the way you encounter an evil team of villians thhat you have to defeat in order<br> to save the reigon and the world. The most appealing thing to me about this game is how even after you beat the champion<br> there is still so much to do. You can complete your pokedex by catching all 315 pokemon and even capture some legendary<br> pokemon. You can battle online and trade with others. I have seen people sink in hundreds of hours. You could go years without<br> completing the entire game %100. I personaly have sank many hours and the addicting nature and appealing charm of the game<br> still draws my towards it to this day. This is why pokemon sapphire is my 2nd favorite game.
