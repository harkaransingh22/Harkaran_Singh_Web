        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <p>Red Dead Redemption is a western themed third person action/adventure game. The player controls one main protagonist named John Marston and goes around completing sets of missions to progress through the story. The missions can be triggered in any order once the player unlocks them. Outside of missions the player is free to roam around and do many side activities. Such as taming horses, gang hideouts, black jack, hunting, arm wrestling, hunting bounties, camping, dueling, cattle hurding, poker and money other crimes such as robbing people. The game also has a honor system, If you do crimes your honor goes down but if you help people then your honor goes up. The more honor you have the nicer people are to you. However if you commit crimes around witnesses or deputies they will run to the sherifs station and you will get a wanted level, the higher your wanted level the more officers come after you. If you get caught by the police you have to pay a bounty however if the payer does not have enough money then they have to complete bounty missions until they have enough. If a player takes out all police than bounty hunters will continue to track the player until they pay off the bounty. Gunplay is also a huge part of RDR. Players can take cover while shooting and peak around corners to scout for enemys. John Marston also has a special ability that slows down time to make it easier to aim with your weapon. This ability was added to compensate for the lack of much weapon customization due to the time period. Players have a wide array of weapons they can choose from, the weapons in the game include pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, scoped rifles, kives, lassos and throwing weapons such as tomahawks. The wide array of weapons adds a lot of replay ability to the game. Players can choose how they want to approach a mission, going in guns blazing or picking off enemies with a scoped rifle.</p>

        <h2>Multiplayer:</h2>
        <p>The multiplayer for Red Dead Redemption has a maximum of 16 players per session. There were 3 gamemodes initially; a free for all where players try to get the most kills, a team based mode where a group of 4 people have to try to get a certain amount of kills before other teams and a capture the flag mode where teams have to defend their bag of gold from other players. Each game begins with a standoff and the winners are able to move to any part of the map to make preperations for battle, they are able to find crates scattered around the map which contain ammo, weapons and powerups. Players are able to level up as they play and different levels award different things such as different weapon skins and mounts. Later on in the life cycle of the game more modes were added through DLC. The game mode included in the Liars and Cheats DLC was Stronghold where two teams attack and defend and switch roles at the end of each round. Two other modes were added with the Undead Nightmares; Undead overrun where players (solo or team) have to survive incoming hordes of zombies and land grab. Outside of these modes players are free to roam around the map doing whatever they wish.</p>
