<h2>About:</h2>
<p  class="about">Rockstar Games is a video game publisher and developer that was founded in 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. The two founders of the company were named Sam and Dan Houser. Rockstar Games publishes and developes Third-Person,Action-Adevnture games. Many of their games have very famous franchises such as Grand Theft Auto, Manhunt, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne. Rockstar is often under fire for the amount of violence they incorporate into their games and the amount of freedom they give the player. Rockstar has been taken to court many times by people disliking what they include in their games. Many People view Rockstar as just a developer that enjoys only violence and a developer that can never have deeper messages in their games. However that is a false fact many Rockstar Games titles are misunderstood because of the violence they have but people tend to overlook the darker themes that Rockstar includes. Some of these themes include loss, revenge, betrayal, drugs, government corruption and torture. Many of the more darker themes are overlooked due to the fun and wacky nature they use to cloud the serious tone. The new trend in the gaming industry is releasing sequels to games that dont need them just to cash in on the success of the original Game. Rockstar never releases an unfinished game they spend years upon years perfecting the game to make sure that consumers get their moneys worth. The reasons listed are just touching the tip of the iceberg on why Rockstar Games in my opinion is the best developer in the video game industry.</p>
