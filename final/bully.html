        <h2 class="bully">GAMEPLAY:</h2>
        <p>Bully is an open world sandbox action-adventure game set in a school environment. The player is free to explore the school campus and town, or to complete the main missions. If you see a bully torment a fellow student you can choose to either help or leave them alone. You can also participate in boxing outside of school.The mode takes place in third person with the camera behind Jimmy. Jimmy can move around, block, duck, and throw punches. He and his opponent both have a health meter, much like those in fighting games. The fights have 30 second rounds. To win, Jimmy must empty his opponent's health meter and then throw a knockout punch.Between rounds, Jimmy regains approximately 30% of his health meter. His opponents regain only a minuscule amount of their meter between rounds. You can also play races as you unlock them there are three types of races. Street, Grand Prix and Carnival Races. Races unlock as you progres and increase in difficulty with different vehicles being available. The game also makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities. School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. English, for example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy completes the level, he learns to apologize to bullies, deliver better taunts, apologize to Prefects and finally to apologize to the police.Jimmy has a multitude of weapons available, although they tend to run along the lines of things a school boy might actually attain, such as slingshots, bags of marbles, stink bombs, and later in the game, a bottle rocket launcher and a spud cannon. He also has an assortment of vehicles to operate  mainly bicycles with different abilities, but also a moped, a go-kart, a skateboard and on rare occasions, a lawn mower. </p>

        <h2 class="bully">CONTROVERSY:</h2>
        <p> The title of Bully itself caused a great deal of controversy, leading to the game being marketed as Canis Canem Edit in PAL regions, which means "dog eat dog" in Latin. While groups such as Bullying Online and Peaceaholics have criticized the game for glorifying or trivializing school bullying, some groups counter that the protagonist is just as much defending himself and crusading to end bullying in the Academy, and that picking on girls or weaker kids is a serious transgression with serious ramifications. Most of the criticism surrounding Bully was voiced before the content of the game was available to the public. In 2006, the United States-based Entertainment Software Rating Board officially gave Bully a rating of T. Some of the controvercial content includes Homosexuality. Some missions in the game allow the player to kiss fellow male students. This angered parents who did not want their children to be exposed to this. But rocktsar games responded by saying that they chose to include that part of the game to show that this often happens at schools and the student get punished when it is not a very serious at all. Bully is often on lists of the most controvercial games of all time as are many Rockstar Games titles.</p>
